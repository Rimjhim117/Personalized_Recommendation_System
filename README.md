# Personalized-Recommendation-System-

This project is a web-based recipe recommendation system built with Python and the Flask framework. It uses a simple algorithm to suggest recipes based on user ratings, providing an intuitive way for users to discover new dishes.

ðŸ“‹ Features

    Recipe Discovery: Users can get a list of recommended recipes directly from the home page.

    Top-Rated Recommendations: The system suggests the highest-rated recipes from a curated dataset.

    User Feedback and Ratings: The application allows users to provide ratings and submit feedback for recipes, contributing to future improvements.

    RESTful API Endpoints: A simple server provides endpoints for retrieving recommendations and submitting data.

    Data-Driven: The system is powered by three CSV files that store recipe details, user ratings, and user feedback.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

    Python: The primary programming language for the application logic.

    Flask: A lightweight web framework used to build the web server and API endpoints.

    Pandas: A data manipulation library for reading and processing the recipe, ratings, and feedback data from CSV files.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

    app.py: The main Python script that runs the Flask server, defines the routes, and contains the recommendation logic.

    recipes.csv: Contains a database of recipes, including their names, ingredients, and instructions.

    ratings.csv: Stores user-submitted ratings for different recipes.

    feedback.csv: A log file that records user feedback on recipes.

    README.md: The file you are currently reading.

    RecipeID: A unique identifier for each recipe.

    RecipeName: The name of the recipe.

    Ingredients: A list of ingredients needed for the recipe.

    Instructions: The cooking instructions for the recipe.

    Cuisine: The origin of the recipe (e.g., "Italian", "Mexican").

    DietaryPreference: Any dietary tags associated with the recipe (e.g., "Vegetarian", "Vegan").

ratings.csv
